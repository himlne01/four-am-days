I am half done with my undergrad schooling. I have half left to go. Something tells me I am currently in "the good ole days," 
but from April and May, I do not think I would have agreed with you.\\n"Intention" is one of the key words of the year. You know when you know a piece of information but it take a while for you to truly connect the meaning of the word to something relatable in your life? When you make any form of connection, it more or less hits you like a bus. Putting your energy, strength, and heart into a series of actions or a goal is very powerful. The saying is true: you can get a lot done when you put your mind to it.\\nThe main reason I connected with the word "Intention" is through Ultimate Frisbee. If I ferociously put my mind into doing one thing at a time, I actually play better. /Who would have thought?/ Some people may get confused with the word "Intense" which means playing with competitive ferociousness. No. I mean another word for focus. But you can focus on anything; you can focus on distractions. With "Intention," you put the focus 
on your goal.'),

To live in the city with public transportation and my bike? Or to live in a smaller town and make the big purchase?
